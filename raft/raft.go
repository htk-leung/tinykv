		method. It is stored with sender's ID and later forwarded to the leader by
		rafthttp package.

		'MessageType_MsgAppend' contains log entries to replicate. A leader calls bcastAppend,
		which calls sendAppend, which sends soon-to-be-replicated logs in 'MessageType_MsgAppend'
		type. When 'MessageType_MsgAppend' is passed to candidate's Step method, candidate reverts
		back to follower, because it indicates that there is a valid leader sending
		'MessageType_MsgAppend' messages. Candidate and follower respond to this message in
		'MessageType_MsgAppendResponse' type.

		A.
		- leader receives proposal to append entries to log
		- leader adds entries
		- leader calls bcastappend to send entries to peers

		'MessageType_MsgRequestVoteResponse' contains responses from voting request. When 'MessageType_MsgRequestVoteResponse' is
		passed to candidate, the candidate calculates how many votes it has won. If
		it's more than majority (quorum), it becomes leader and calls 'bcastAppend'.
		If candidate receives majority of votes of denials, it reverts back to
		follower.

		B.
		- candidate becomes leader
		- leader calls bcastappend to send entry to peers

		'MessageType_MsgSnapshot' requests to install a snapshot message. When a node has just
		become a leader or the leader receives 'MessageType_MsgPropose' message, it calls
		'bcastAppend' method, which then calls 'sendAppend' method to each
		follower. In 'sendAppend', if a leader fails to get term or entries,
		the leader requests snapshot by sending 'MessageType_MsgSnapshot' type message.
